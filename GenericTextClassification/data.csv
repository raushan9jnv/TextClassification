In reviewing the invoices I see that they look like JCI Canada. The Sodexo unit sent to is Sodexo - ADP - Toronto ON 129 Spadina, Canada but the rest of the address is US 3847 Crum Rd Attn Cara Knight YOUNGSTOWN OH 44515-0000.
Is this why they failed. We will need additional information from JCI before reaching out to the units.
Thank you for your help.

Please send the Invoice PDF for payment for this invoice as the tax values cannot be sent thru EDI unless a change is made at IBM.
Would like to have a discussion on this in the future.

This Sodexo Invoice is erroring EDI due to

  *   invoiceCurrencyCode = CAD
and

  *   All the Canadian tax values in RED are null.
  *   The tax amount missing in the calculation is in the US Tax field invTaxAmount.

Please respond to the following (from below in email) with the Invoice PDF. Thanks.

Good Morning I have attached the invoices along with my findings. Please correct and submit EDI.

Invoice 23186553 has one charge for 199.01 but the invoice total is 228.86. Please review to find the missing charges, add to the file, and submit.
If you have confirmed there are no additional charges, please update the invoice amount and total. Invoice is attached.

Invoice 89254419 has 357.00 in charges but a total of 374.85. Please review to find the missing charges to add or update to the new total since some of your line items have zero. Correct and submit.  Invoice is attached.

Thank you and have a great day.

Subject: FW: JOHNSON CONTROLS - FIRE USA | INVOICE FAILURE NOTICE | Incident# 868757

In reviewing the invoices I see that they look like JCI Canada. The Sodexo unit sent to is Sodexo - ADP - Toronto ON 129 Spadina, Canada but the rest of the address is US 3847 Crum Rd Attn Cara Knight YOUNGSTOWN OH 44515-0000.
Is this why they failed. We will need additional information from JCI before reaching out to the units.
Thank you for your help.

Please send the Invoice PDF for payment for this invoice as the tax values can not be sent thru EDI unless a change is made at IBM.
Would like to have a discussion on this in the future.

This Sodexo Invoice is erroring EDI due to

  *   invoiceCurrencyCode = CAD
and

  *   All the Canadian tax values in RED are null.
  *   The tax amount missing in the calculation is in the US Tax field invTaxAmount.

Please respond to the following (from below in email) with the Invoice PDF. Thanks.

Sales Support - Good evening.  I tried to submit a new ""Case"" in SFDC for this, but after it said it was confirmed ""entered"", I could not find it anywhere to validate.



So for the sake of time, I am emailing to see if you can assist with getting this new PSA booked through CCA.  All of the required approvals are below and attached for same-month inspections, as well as all needed paperwork.



I have copied the PSR who is assisting, so please copy her when you confirm it has been booked so she can work with the local scheduling team.



Please let me know if there are any questions, and thank you for your assistance.

Mike - Good morning.  I think we may have mixed this one up with another IKEA store when you were giving approvals, but still need it for this one.  The PSR is checking with her inspection dept to confirm we have the manpower for the monthly fire pump churn, annual extinguisher inspection and semi-annual kitchen hood inspection.  In the meantime, can you please reply back with your DOA approval.  Total contract value is $19,856, so your DOA should be all that is needed.



Thanks and please let me know if you have any questions.



Aleigha - please let me know ASAP if there are any issues with the inspections being scheduled for October.  I will also need written email approval from your area leadership to attach to the booking package since we're past the 15th.



Thank you,

Rosie - Good afternoon.  Frank has reached out separately about scheduling their first inspections (fire extinguisher and kitchen hoods) at the IKEA Round Rock store, but I feel like we may be mistaking this with another property.



I just spoke with Dana Hoffman as well, and unfortunately I think we're talking about 2 different IKEA stores.  In my original budget #'s, I had provided a price for IKEA Round Rock (which is in TX and the FM is Frank De La Cruz).  We were told that we were not being awarded that store for inspections and we proceeded with just the 5 sites in Wave 1 and 2 sites in Wave 2 that JCI was the incumbent on.



Then more recently, I was asked to provide an inspection proposal for 6 additional IKEA sites, and one of these was the Live Oak Store (which is ALSO in TX and the FM is ALSO Frank De La Cruz).  This is the pricing I sent you most recently, and you said below that we were about double from our original budget $'s.



In looking through my documents, I do not see that I provided budget pricing originally for the Live Oak store.  So, the price I sent you above would be accurate on what Johnson Controls would cover.  This pricing for Live Oak is a bit higher than normal because we included monthly fire pump inspections, but at most other stores we are only performing the annual inspection.  I checked with our local representative who performed the site survey, and she said she checked with the ISS personnel that met her. She explained that ISS was performing the weekly pump churns themselves, but were having their previous inspection company still perform he monthly's which is why I kept them in.  I can take this off and just leave it as annual, but I think the bigger picture is that the two sites may be getting mixed up.



If you would like Round Rock covered as well, we will need to set up a site survey ASAP to confirm the devices from my original budget pricing is accurate.  I can help coordinate this, but we confirm that all of my notes above are correct first?  Let me know if you and Frank are able to have a quick call tomorrow to walk through this?



Thanks and I look forward to your reply,

In reviewing the invoices I see that they look like JCI Canada. The Sodexo unit sent to is Sodexo - ADP - Toronto ON 129 Spadina, Canada but the rest of the address is US 3847 Crum Rd Attn Cara Knight YOUNGSTOWN OH 44515-0000.

Is this why they failed. We will need additional information from JCI before reaching out to the units.

Thank you for your help.

INC7277553,P5,SGX Customer DSS Update,"Yesterday was the 15th which is when the ""SGX Customer DSS Update"" process is supposed to run which uploads the customer categorization data into ACE.

The file was placed in the appropriate directory and when I checked today the file was gone which I take it to mean it was processed but we have yet to receive any e-mail notification that it actually ran along with the log file of the run.

This process has been running for going on four years now and never had this issue of not getting the log file until these past few months and this issue needs to be resolved.

We need the log ASAP in case there are processing/categorization issues because this data feeds downstream systems and runs all off shoring efforts.

Hello Charlie,
As per my findings given below:
1) User has manually created these sales orders.
2) Generated Hard allocation & pick list also done by manual.
3) We have job ""FDSLS1"" of this allocation & picklist but that seq's has been disabled as per business request.
4) My assumption here is user has printed the pick list without allocation.
5) So system has waiting for the hard allocation step complete. Once completed then only CDC940 job picked up the below mentioned shipments.
6) CDC940 job completed at 9:06 AM EST today same time EDI940 file (EDI940112_1123202232756.TXT) got generated.
Note:
I have checked with ""Charlie"" to provide the screenshot of print picklist session screenshot with input.

Puede ser porque el Status de las líneas del grupo de instalación constan como  ""Para Instalar"" en vez de ""Instalado"",",it.be.ams-baan-support.eu,BAAN EMEA,"Hello Nuria,

As per the standard functionality of LN once service contract for an installation group is activated, whatever the installations that you add to the installation group later will still be in 'to-be installed' status.
When adding a new installation to a group that is covered by a service contract, most likely the contract needs to be adjusted (increase in contract sales amount).
So in order to get the new installations to status 'installed' you need to create a contract incidental change. In this change you can add contract configuration lines for the new installations and change the price if desired. However, this is not required. All that is really necessary is to add a contract incidental change and activate it(without increasing the sales price).
When you activate the contract change, the status of the installations will be updated from 'to be installed' to 'installed'.

Can you please review & advise how /why credit invoice 00073882282 was Accepted in Oracle?   

Per the branch invoices, 00073882282 and 00073882244  should cancel each other out.  For invoice 00073882244 I understand a credit could be done to cancel the invoice, however unsure of what needs to be done for credit invoice 00073882282. 

Can you please review and advise what would need to be done to correct this?

PDF Invoices and credit memos are not sent to customers on a daily basis 
Hello, 
Carlos Quintanilla from JCH-ES, complains like Elena in Italy that invoices are not sent in  a reliable way to customers, 
Can you pls give me : 
1) The alternate email address where the invoices are CC'ed  when sent the invoice to Customers so that we verify if the CC copy is there 
2) the log of last month (I think you don't have more than 1 month) of all invoices and their timestamps that says they were sent to the customer, and we'll compare with the list of customers and their email addresses 
3) the list of JCH-ES customers and the email address populated to send the invoice to (this is a special purpose in Oracle CMF ..) so that we verify if customers have an email address for invoices and the invoice is not sent to them according to the log 

Thanks and regards

Hi Guasmi , 

EI has received incorrect data because of which we are not able to process the messages.
We are not logging the payload for this interface hence it is difficult for us to identify the actual error.

On the Previous INC7210285, we received notification on the available BOL.

We reached out to the factory (SAT - San Antonio) and they state the BOL #8000032936 is tied to order 002-01B/002-01C (tag along) which is posted correctly, as well as the order 002-01C/002-01B (tag along).

They state they do not have a means to cancel the BOL on the factory side.

We need help to get the order 002-01C and 002-01B marked as shipped and have the cost hit the contract.

The factory is stating they are unable to assist.  We are unsure how to accomplish this task.

ORIGINAL Case data:

We are missing cost for 1N0T0544 Order 002 lines 01C and 02A.  The factory confirmed when the shipping was loaded on the BOL in their system, the quantities were entered incorrectly. They were not able to correct on their end.  

We have attached the BOL that contains the information for 002-01B (and 02C the starter) on page 1.  On Page 2, it shows 002-01C (and 02A the starter).

Please help locate the invoice for lines 002-01C and 02A.  We need the costs and to have the orders lines show as shipped in Order Details.

Vendor-Parts-Request and Warehouse-Parts-Request with more than one Line, the lines are transferred into Oracle (iProc) alphabetic instead of Line-Numbers - see attached example by PRQ-00241217 - for example Needle valve in SMAX Pos. 1 in Oracle (iProc) it is Pos. 3 - should be same, because if we order lines like the supplier offer, otherwised it's mixed-up.

Please check the issue and let us know.

Thanks,

[12:28 PM] Claudia Trottmann
is that the rule of SMAX PRQ?

[12:28 PM] Claudia Trottmann
this was only examples...

[12:28 PM] Claudia Trottmann
and is there a way to change this rule?

[12:30 PM] Satyanarayana Edururi
Sanchit, based on first come first serve only it will work right into oracle creation

[12:30 PM] Satyanarayana Edururi
there are no rules right I think

[12:31 PM] Claudia Trottmann
Satyanarayana EdururiSanchit, based on first come first serve only it will work right into oracle creation
that's not how is working, we have checked all variation, but it has always transferred in alphabetic..

[12:31 PM] Claudia Trottmann
like a, b, c, d, etc.

[12:31 PM] Claudia Trottmann
at the end in Oracle
 like 1

[12:31 PM] Satyanarayana Edururi
ok

[12:32 PM] Sanchit Singh
Hi Claudia

[12:32 PM] Sanchit Singh
let me check once and confirm

[12:34 PM] Sanchit Singh
Can you share the snap from oracle , in which it is in alphabetic?


[12:35 PM] Claudia Trottmann
and here how we have given in in SMAX

[12:35 PM] Claudia Trottmann
the first Printscreen is from iProc/Oracle

[1:20 PM] Sanchit Singh
Hi Claudia

[1:21 PM] Sanchit Singh
I have checked and found out it is same case for every PRQ , as it is standard Process in oracle 

[1:23 PM] Claudia Trottmann
ok, and there is now way to change this rules? because somethimes the supplier is confused, because the Positions are not the same as on the offer, and mostly is than the ""FREIGHT"" for example on line one (freight is normaly the last line)..

[1:26 PM] Sanchit Singh
I don't think we can change it , but let me have a internal discussion with the team , will update you soon

[4:34 PM] Sanchit Singh
Hi Claudia

[4:34 PM] Sanchit Singh
As informed , we cannot do anything as it is a oracle standard process

[4:36 PM] Sanchit Singh
All the lines comes like this only in oracle

[4:36 PM] Claudia Trottmann
so after transferring into Oracle oracle is sorting it alphabetic?

[4:36 PM] Sanchit Singh
yes

[4:36 PM] Sanchit Singh
not only alphabetic, but numeric too

[4:38 PM] Sanchit Singh
For eg if the description for one line  is ""12 xxx ""
andd for seconf ""11 xxx""
In oracle the first  line will be  be 11 xxx

[4:44 PM] Claudia Trottmann
ok I understand, thanks for your imput

Hi Team, 
We found out an issue where the sales orders below had correct pricing and after 12 OCT it has been changed without our knowledge or intervention. I would need to understand what has happened since it is affecting invoicing and we already have 2 invoices incorrect. 

We need to understand who changed the prices, if system or a person to ensure this won't happen again. 
Oracle 11i - JCI Spain - JBE ES
Sales order numbers: 63699, 64568, 64564,64847 - Still open orders
Sales order numbers: 63940, 63986 - already invoice and we need to credit.
Attached is the screenshot of the field that was changed and we need to get history of changes.
Thank you for prompt support.

Br, Patricia.

Hi Madhav,
 
Yes, you are correct. The other DB link used in the query was dl_ebs_na_frp41_ap_a_usable. But in this DB link, AP_SUPPLIER_SITES_ALL table is not found. Could you please let me know the correct DB link which has the table AP_SUPPLIER_SITES_ALL.

Hi Arun,
 
If I recall correctly there is other DB link used in the query which was shown in screenshare. It is something like this dl_ebs_na_frp41_ap_a_usable
 
For some of other tables above one is used. Ex for ap_suppliers table.
 
Please verify if the name is correct or not and proceed with your analysis.

Hi Madhav/Team,
 
As discussed in the call, we are suspecting that the problem might be with the database name dl_ebs_na_frt31_ap_a_usable.AP_SUPPLIER_SITES_ALL. As per the discussion, the 't' in the database name will be referring for testing, Could you please provide us production database name which should be used. 
 
Could you please prioritise this and provide us with the information ASAP as our user is expecting the solution for it.
 
Thanks,

We are checking in the file- JCI_ICM_CONTRACT_SALESPERSON_20221001 and attached the screenshot in below mail chain.

Can you help us understand why the contract 2N810355 is missing for emp- 1728867 for Sep month end file as its only present for emp 1162848.

Hi Keerthiprabha,

I have checked with Vyankatesh, and his name as 'Approver 1' is not reflecting.
We need to add him as approver then I'll add into excel tool.

User Name - GID
Vyankatesh Ashok Nilee - jnileev

Dears,

Quick questions:

- Is there a mean to have a copy of a Jira report filter sent periodically by mail in an excel/csv format?
o This would help support one of our own on-going internal initiative 

- How can we enable the Jira Cloud plug-in in excel? This feature does not work.
o This feature could be a good alternative to fetch the desired data
 

Please let me know.
Thank you for your support,

Best Regards, / Met vriendelijk groet, / Bien à vous,

URGENT - 277 - Incorrect Currency conversion for 2 invoices of BRUDRA Vendor

Region:
MEA

Select Country:
IBC

Company Code:
277

Module & Domain:
Purchase Ledger

Description:
This is to highlight that, the below mentioned 2 invoices of BRUDRA vendor are having currency conversion issue (Like last month’s J.T.O. Systems invoice). 
Could you please get this corrected in iScala asap. Ideally CZK 6,632.66 should be EUR 270.34, however it got converted as EUR 162,753.01, which is causing huge difference if FX revaluation. (it is again CZK currency is getting multiplied in iScala instead of dividing by conversion rate for new vendor).

Please provide permanent solution so that this will not happen for any new vendor invoices",it.be.iscala-support.na,iScala,Other,Not Applicable,Other,Other,2023-01-11 08:14:38

There is an issue with recalculating INV amount to local currency in entity B1 when recalculating from CZK to local currency EUR.  Could you please check it urgently?
As an example INV 1312206257 (supplier code 45450) booked for amount 2270.21 czk is recalculated to local currency as 558738.15 eur (instead of 925eur). It seems the amount is multiplied by currency rate (24,253812) instead of dividing to get correct amount. Please correct this urgently. 
THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ONE INVOICE with this issue!!! so it should not be corrected on this particular invoice level. 
PLEASE CORRECT THIS URGENTLY

The current latest 'Estimate 08' in PM is showing an incorrect total contract value causing an unbilled balance remaining in the PM database. The correct total contract value is €631,805.00 that has been invoiced and paid fully. The wrong 'Estimate 08' amount €782,765.00 in PM is causing an unbilled amount €150,960.00 in the PM report GLB_PR_717_ProjectMonitoringSummary. Please see attached the print-screen of the project data in PM and ProjectMonitoringSummary report for P753230010.

Dear Service Helpdesk Team

Please kindly check the error of Trans No. 230401274.
It’s transaction for PO invoice and we need your support to restore it in Sub Ledger and post it to General Ledger.

Accident: At first, I posted the PO invoice of overseas supplier completely.
But I found it has price diff 0.01 THB and we need to access “Print Invoice Journal” to adjust price diff.
And then I adjusted A/C and text.
Finally I clicked Enter and it makes Application Logic Error. But PO amount was used up for posting this transaction.

I could not find the transaction number 230401274 in the “Print Invoice Journal”.
Although I could find it in the list of Open Items, it shows error message “Original invoice does not have transaction lines. Continue reversing?”

Dear Team, we would like to ask following: 1. Is there available free field in iscala that could be used for previous contract number identification when renewing PSA. This field would have to be mandatory and business person would need to fill it in, when renewing a PSA contract. 2. This field would need to be available and populated on the report: GLB_CM_802_Backlog .3. if field available, can we massively update existing contracts with previous contract numbers, if we provide mapping? We require this field to be available and maintained in order to improve our reporting for RIF Statistical calculation. If there is no linkage to the previous contracts, we report results as contracts would end and we lost it, rather then it was renewed - we are reporting worse results than they are in reality. thank you for your feedback.

- Cash App team cannot stamp a payment complement, if one of the invoices paid does not have UUID stored.

Description: 
Hi,
First of all, we prepared the automatic payment file for open invoices.
These payments was for open euro currency invoices.
After the payment process, we uploaded the payment journal file to the iscala.
We were thinking it will map with A01TR03 (ING Bank Euro account), but it was mapped with B110TR02. Therefore, bank account balance on iscala is not matching the real amount in ING bank statement.
Could you please help us about the issue to fix it?
Thanks,

Erdi

Hi team, (as in previous ticket num. ISST-36075 - ticket closed because due to lack of feedback from my side ) inv. 22000255056 (customer Varga Viktor - 8426243967) was not billed properly. Billing activities haven't been closed, which caused us a difference. Invoice appears in report 305 (report related to Subledger) but not in 200/206 (General ledger). Could you please fix it? I am not able to see accounting in iScala either. Thank you.

This is not just one day issue it started few weeks ago but it is becoming worse in recent days.

Hello, please could you provide us with explanations for PWC related to transaction numbers:
- 220401491 - This is a booking done by Bank team. Amruta did a mistake when posting one payment and that part was reversed but the same number was used (showing different date that the original booking. Please see the attached email conversation with Bank team. PWC auditors are asking why the document number was not close, and why there was not a new transaction number used for the reversal? 
- 220943596 - This a booking of an invoice done by AP team. However, there are 2 different users shown and different dates. Aishwarya explained that she did the booking correctly and that the system added 2 more lines. Could you explain why there are more users show and different numbers under the same transaction number.? Please see attached email conversation.
The matter is, that PWC expects that one transaction number has the same user and the same date for all lines.
Please could you provide us with explanations at your earliest convenience, as this is needed for PWC audit?
Thank you very much.
